# R-ShinyApplication-Analysis-of-car-sales

The analysis is conducted on a car sales dataset available at Kaggle.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether factors such as engine size, horsepower, and fuel efficiency differ across groups of cars based on both vehicle type and country of origin.

A one-way ANOVA is used to determine effects when using just one categorical variable.

A two-way ANOVA is used to determine effects across multiple categories (also known as a factorial ANOVA) and also whether interaction effects are present,i.e. the combined effects of factors on the dependent variable as opposed to considering them in isolation.
